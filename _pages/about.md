Hello! I'm Xiaoyue, a third-year master student at Southeast University, Nanjing, China in the [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/). Under the supervision of Prof. Pan Liu and Prof. Zhibin Li, I have done some researches, projects and teaching tasks during the past two years. 

The researches focused on traffic flow characteristics at highway weaving sections and highway work zones using vehicle trajectory data extracted from aerial videos recorded by drones. And I will pay attention to how to regulate vehicles near highway work zones to improve traffic operation, using an integrated strategy that combines lane-change control with speed control, to finish my master's thesis. Projects were mainly applications of dynamic traffic management on smart highways. Besides, I participated in drafting of a local standards ([Hebei Administration for Market Regulation](http://scjg.hebei.gov.cn/info/88345) updated on Sept. 27, 2022) and a white paper. And I served as a teaching assistant in an undergraduate course, Traffic Safety, in Spring 2021 and Spring 2022.
